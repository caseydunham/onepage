This is a collection of so called OnePage games that I created a few years ago.

I initially heard about the OnePage game from http://www.gamedevdad.com/?p=211.

They were originally written to be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 on Windows XP.

I have updated them to work with Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express and it seems to work fine on Windows 7 (64bit).
